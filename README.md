## Git Branch Strategy

To ensure smooth collaboration and maintain code quality, this project follows a Git Flow branching strategy:

- **main**: The production-ready branch. Only thoroughly tested, stable code is merged here.
- **develop**: The integration branch for features and fixes. All completed features and bugfixes are merged here before going to main.
- **feature/***: For new features. Branch off from `develop` and merge back into `develop` when complete.
  - Example: `feature/event-creation`, `feature/auth-jwt`
- **release/***: For preparing a new production release. Branch off from `develop`, finalize, then merge into both `main` and `develop`.
  - Example: `release/v1.0.0`
- **hotfix/***: For urgent fixes to production. Branch off from `main`, then merge back into both `main` and `develop`.
  - Example: `hotfix/fix-login-bug`

**Basic Workflow:**
1. Create a feature branch from `develop` for each new feature or improvement.
2. Open a pull request (PR) to merge your feature branch into `develop` after review.
3. When ready for release, create a `release/*` branch from `develop`, finalize, then merge into `main` and `develop`.
4. For critical production bugs, use a `hotfix/*` branch from `main`.

This strategy helps keep the codebase organized, supports parallel development, and ensures production stability.
